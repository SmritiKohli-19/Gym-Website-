# 🏋️‍♂️ Strong Fitness Gym Website

---

## 🚧 Project Overview

The **Strong Fitness Gym Website** is a full-stack web application designed to represent a large-scale business with a sleek and user-friendly interface. This project 
integrates a fully responsive front-end, a dynamic back-end, and a robust database to provide a complete user experience.

Currently, the website is a **work in progress**, but you're welcome to explore the development journey as it evolves. From layout design to server-side logic and
data management, every component is being carefully crafted to reflect modern web development best practices.

🔍 **Technologies Involved:**  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- PHP / Node.js (planned for backend)  
- MySQL (for database)
